* AbstractVLambdaInlining
We wish to investigate whether the JVM ...
1. inlines lambdas/method references across 1 invocation (similar to kotlin
   ~inline~)
2. can use devirtualization to inline the abstract implementation of a derived
   class in a tight loop if that implementation is trivial.

Conclusion: 1. is true, 2. isn't.
** Results
- Manual loop took: 0.00491 millis
- Ineritance took: 121.497989 millis
- Inline (Lambda) took: 0.137569 millis
